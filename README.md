# The Capy Programming Language

A statically typed, compiled programming language, largely inspired by Jai, Odin, and Zig.
Compile-time evaluation coming soon.

Now on all your favorite Operating Systems! Thanks [cranelift](https://cranelift.dev/)!

```capy
to_print :: "Hello, World!\n";

main :: () -> i32 {
    // prints "Hello, World!" to the screen
    puts(to_print);

    // exit with code 0
    0
}

puts :: (some_text: string) extern; // libc defined
```

*From [`examples/readme.capy`](./examples/readme.capy)*

## Features

Static arrays,

```capy
my_array := [] i32 { 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 };

my_array[2] = 10;
```

Pointers,

```capy
foo := 5;
bar := ^mut foo;

bar^ = 10;
```

Structs,

```capy
Person :: struct {
    name: string,
    age: i32
};

gandalf := Person {
    name: "Gandalf",
    age: 2000,
};

// birthday!
gandalf.age = gandalf.age + 1;
```

First Class Functions,

```capy
add :: (x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
};

mul :: (x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x * y
};

apply_2_and_3 :: (fun: (x: i32, y: i32) -> i32) -> i32 {
    fun(2, 3)
};

apply_2_and_3(add);
apply_2_and_3(mul);
```

... All compiled to machine code (I'm so proud of this).

Look at the [`examples`](./examples/) folder to see more.

## Getting Started

First clone this repo,

```shell
git clone https://github.com/capy-language/capy.git
```

Then install the capy command with cargo,

```shell
cargo install --path crates/capy
```

Make sure you have `gcc` installed,

Then compile and run your code,

```shell
capy run examples/readme.capy
```

Or if you just want to build the final executable,

```shell
capy build examples/readme.capy
```

Only Windows and Linux have been tested, so tell me if you get it working on MacOS :)

## Limitations

You have to manually include all the files your code references in the `capy` command, although this might change in the future.
Frankly, a lot of this might change in the future.

If you want to use libc functions, define them with `extern` as above.
Variadic functions do not work. You *could* try explicitly defining `printf`
to take 3 arguments, but this won't work for floats, which are passed into
variadic functions differently depending on the calling convention.
Cranelift is [currently working on adding variadic support](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/1030),
so that might be added in the future.

Currently, `gcc` must be installed for the compiler to work.
It is only used for linking to libc and producing a proper executable.

## Shout Outs

Big shout out to [Luna Razzaghipour](https://github.com/lunacookies), the structure of this entire codebase is largely based on [gingerbread](https://github.com/gingerbread-lang/gingerbread) and [eldiro](https://github.com/lunacookies/eldiro).
Her help in teaching how programming languages really work is immeasurable and I'm very thankful.

Big shout out to [cranelift](https://cranelift.dev/). Trying to get LLVM on windows was just way too much effort for me and cranelift made all my dreams come true.

I know the cranelift documentation isn't the greatest, so if anyone wants to use this repo to see how I've implemented higher-level features such as arrays, structs, first class functions, etc. then it's all in [`crates/codegen`](./crates/codegen/).

The capybara logo was AI generated by [imagine.art](https://www.imagine.art/), so shout out to them as well :)
